          <h2>Hey there, lovely people!</h2>
          <p>
            Allow me to introduce myself—I'm Derya Deniz, your friendly
            neighborhood coder and art enthusiast. I graduated from Boğaziçi
            University in 2019 with a degree in teaching mathematics. Although
            my path eventually led me to coding, my educational background has
            instilled in me a logical and analytical mindset that I bring to my
            development projects.

      <h2>A Journey of Creativity and Code 🎨🖥️</h2>

      <p>
        At the age of 28, I embarked on an exciting journey to blend my love for
        coding with my passion for creativity. When I'm not immersed in lines of
        code, you can find me surrounded by a delightful bunch of 15 cats. Their
        playful antics provide endless inspiration and joy. 🐱❤️
      </p>
      <h2>The Canvas of Artistic Expression 🎨✨</h2>
      <p>
        Art has always held a special place in my heart, and I've had the
        incredible opportunity to showcase my work in both group and personal
        exhibitions. In 2018, my art graced the walls of a captivating
        exhibition in Turkey, where I had the pleasure of connecting with fellow
        artists and art enthusiasts. Then, in 2020, I embarked on an
        unforgettable journey to Japan, where I shared my creativity in a
        personal exhibition. The experience was truly magical and allowed me to
        immerse myself in the rich culture and vibrant art scene. 🌟✨🎉
      </p>
      <h2>From Teaching to Frontend Development 👩‍🏫🚀</h2>
      <p>
        Prior to my adventures in coding, I had a fulfilling career in teaching
        mathematics. In 2019, I embarked on an exciting teaching journey,
        sharing the wonders of mathematics with enthusiastic students. While I
        cherished the opportunity to make a positive impact on their lives, I
        couldn't ignore my deep-rooted love for coding and design. It was in
        2014, during a computer class, that the HTML/CSS magic first sparked
        within me. I knew then that I had found my true calling.
      </p>
      <h2>Embracing SheCodes and Beyond 🌈🌍🎓</h2>
      <p>
        As destiny would have it, my journey recently led me to the beautiful
        Netherlands, where I continue to explore new horizons. Joining SheCodes
        was a game-changer—I've already earned certifications and crafted some
        awesome projects! With each milestone, I've been able to expand my
        skills and embrace the world of frontend wizardry. But it's not just
        about the certificates and projects—it's about the thrill of learning,
        growing, and connecting with the vibrant tech community.
      </p>
      <h2>Let's Create Magic Together! ✨🌟💻</h2>

        excited to collaborate with like-minded individuals and create
        extraordinary experiences. Whether it's building user-friendly websites
        or crafting visually stunning interfaces, I'm always up for the
